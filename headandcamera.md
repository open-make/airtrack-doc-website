# Construction of the head fixation and platform tracking

In order do keep the head and camera in the same place a rigid mount is needed.

## Placing vertical mounting {pagestep}

- Place three [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:6} in each 48 cm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the [center air table](fromstep){Qty:1}. 
    - The nuts must point upwards. 

    - Move on both sides the central nut to the center of the 48 cm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod).  

- Place in each central nut one of the [M5 round rods](framework.yml#M5Rod){Qty:2}. Attach on each [M5 round rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) a [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC){Qty:2} 15 cm  above the table. 

## Attaching the head fixation {pagestep}

- Place one [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on each of the upwards pointing rods in a right angle. 

- Cut a 38 cm long piece with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw) from the [aluminium rod 12mm diameter](framework.yml#12mmRod){Qty:1} and place it in both [connecting clamps](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the upwards pointing rods. On this rod attach the headfixation.

If the head fixation for the study needed is incompatible with this construction, a placement on the vertical [M5 thread rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) might work.


## Attaching the camera {pagestep}

- 3D print the following file: 
    - Settings: [i](3D_settings_plate.md)
![](models/3_5mm_plate.stl){color: grey}

- Place the two nuts, which are already in the lower center [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod), with a distance of 3.5cm. Mark two points with the distance of the threads on the 3.5mm plate 3D printed plate along one long side with 5 to 10 mm distance from the edge. 

    - Use a [5mm drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill) at both places.

- Take the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam) to mark on the other long side two more drill places with the distance of both holes from the fixation part of the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam). The distance should be around 7 mm.

    - Use a [3mm drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill) at both places.

- Connect the 3.5mm plate by using [M5 screws](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty: 2} with the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod).

- Connect the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam){Qty:1} to the 3.5mm plate by using [M3 screws](screws.yml#m3x5mm_screw){Qty: 2} and [M3 hexagon nuts](screws.yml#m3_hexagon_nuts){Qty: 2}.

You might want to shift the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) in the center a bit to have the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam) in the center.
