# Construction of the head fixation and platform tracking

In order do keep the head and camera in the same place a rigid mount is needed.

## Placing vertical mounting {pagestep}

Place three [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} in each 48 cm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the [center air table](fromstep){Qty:1}. The six nuts must point upwards. Move on both sides the central nut to the center of the 48 cm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod).  Place in each central nut one of the [M5 round rods](framework.yml#M5Rod){Qty:2}. Attach on each [M5 round rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) a [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC){Qty:3} 15 cm  above the table. 

## Attaching the head fixation {pagestep}

Place one [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on each of the upwards pointing rods in a right angle. 

Cut a 38 cm long piece with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw) from the [aluminium rod 12mm diameter](framework.yml#12mmRod){Qty:1} and place it in both [connecting clamps](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the upwards pointing rods. On this rod attach the headfixation.

If the head fixation for the study needed is incompatible with this construction, a placement on the vertical [M5 thread rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) might work.


## Attaching the camera {pagestep}

Insert the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam){Qty:1} in its [3D printed mounting](3d_prints.yml#pixy_hold){Qty:1} and place it in the center below the table on the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod).
