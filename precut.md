# Airtable part 1: Precut of the aluminium profile strut


This section provides information to precut the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod){Qty: 3} and labels the different parts based on length.

For cutting the struts a [metall saw](tools.yml#metallsaw){Qty: 1, Cat:tool} is needed.

>! **Info**

>! In order to achieve a good orthogonal angle at the cut surface, a big saw, maybe a circular bench saw, is recommended to use.
>!
>! With smaller hand saws a lot of endurance and precision is needed and results still could be not sufficient.


>! ** Info **

>! For the case of wrong cuts we recommend to order an additional aluminium strut profile with the length of 2000mm. If it's not needed , these can be used for other use cases and further surrounding constructions. 




Use three [aluminium strut profiles (length: 2000mm)](framework.yml#20x20Rod){qty:3}. 




### Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #1

- Cut four pieces with a length of 400 mm out of one aluminium strut profile. 

- The length of 400m is depended on your wished height. If you follow this cutting guide, your maximum length could be close to 500 mm for the height. In all cases your length for these rods should be not shorter than 250 mm to ensure enough space for the camera below. In the following guide these rods will be referred as 400mm. 


- You have now four [aluminium strut profiles (length: 400mm)]{output, Qty: 4}.


###Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #2

- Cut three pieces with a length of 286 mm and  two pieces with a length of 350 mm out of one aluminium strut profile.

- The 350mm long aluminium strut profiles are for the reward system. You can use longer ones therefore but shorter ones are not recommended.

- You have now three [aluminium strut profiles (length: 286mm)]{output, Qty: 3} and two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 350mm)]{output, Qty: 2}.
 



###Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #3

- Cut two pieces with a length of 440 mm and  two pieces with a length of 480 mm out of one 2000 mm aluminium strut profile.

- You have now two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 440mm)]{output, Qty: 2} and two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 480mm)]{output, Qty: 2}.
