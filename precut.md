### Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #1

- Cut four pieces with a length of 400 mm out of one aluminium strut profile. 

- The length of 400m is depended on your wished height. If you follow this cutting guide, your maximum length could be close to 500 mm for the height. In all cases your length for these rods should be not shorter than 250 mm to ensure enough space for the camera below. In the following guide these rods will be referred as 400mm. 


- You have now four [aluminium strut profiles (length: 400mm)]{output, Qty: 4}.


### Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #2

- Cut three pieces with a length of 286 mm,  two pieces with a length of 350 mm and one 326 mm piece.

- The 350mm long aluminium strut profiles are for the reward system. You can use a longer profile if you want.

- You have now three [aluminium strut profiles (length: 286mm)]{output, Qty: 3}, [aluminium strut profiles (length: 326mm)]{output, Qty: 1} and two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 350mm)]{output, Qty: 2}.
 



### Pieces out of  2000mm aluminium strut profile #3

- Cut two pieces with a length of 440 mm and  two pieces with a length of 480 mm out of one 2000 mm aluminium strut profile.

- You have now two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 440mm)]{output, Qty: 2} and two [aluminium strut profiles (length: 480mm)]{output, Qty: 2}.
