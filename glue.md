# Airtable part 3: Glueing and screwing

{{BOM}}



## Glueing {pagestep}

The next step is to glue the central plexiglas box where the air is floating through. Try to keep the predrilled holes free of glue. It's recommended to place the glue on the 8 mm wide sides of the plexiglass.

- Use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192){qty:some, Cat:tool}[i](glueingadvise.md) to combine the [predrilled 480mmx326mm plexiglass plate](fromstep){Qty:1} with two [predrilled 310x64 plexiglass plate](fromstep){Qty:2}, on the shorter edges. 8 mm should remain on both sides. (The side parts are put in front of the 3mm holes of the top part.)


- Use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) [i](glueingadvise.md) to add the [predrilled 480x64 plexiglass plate](fromstep){Qty:2}. Put some glue on the 3 edges touching other plexiglas plates.

You don't need to wait for the glue to be dry before going to the next step and add the srews.

## Screwing {pagestep}

To further stabilize the box you need to drill screws from the top into the side plexiglass from several places. All holes are all ready predrilled. 



- Screw a [3mm pozidriv screws](screws.yml#3mm_pozidriv){Qty:26} in each 3mm hole of the predrilled 480mmx326mm plexiglass plate](fromstep){Qty:0} into the side plexiglass. 




## Result

You have build the [air table center box]{output, qty:1} without bottom. Because we still need to access the interior of the box, we **do not glue the bottom part** yet.
