If preferred, the bond seam and the surrounding area could be masked with a suitable adhesive tape. Acrifix can then be applied directly from the tube or a syringe onto the joint while avoiding bubble formation. This bond must then be exposed to a suitable light source until it has cured. A “normal” tubular fluorescent lamp (illuminant type 25) or simply the sun will suffice as the light source. This adhesive is cured after about 24 hours.
