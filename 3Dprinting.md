# Floating platform

There are several platforms you can use on the Airtrack. The size of the platfrom and the design of the upper part varies depending on your research question. 

The below part design depends on the type or Air table you are using. For small tables, air is flowing directly and the platform needs to have a rim on its lower part. In large tables, the air is making some balls floating, and the platform should be completeley flat. The balls are used to limit the air flow and by this the needed pressure is reduced to maintain the platform floating.

It's important to be aware about the influence of the material's surface to the mouse. The layer height in the print settings and the material used for the print are the main factors determining the surface's shape.

A 3D printed platform mostly has a flat and slippery surface which doesn't allow the mouse to move as expected. It's recommended to attach some grips or slip-proof materials to allow the mouse to move naturally on the platform.

All recommended printing settings provided the best output on a FLASHFORGE CREATOR 3.

## Large platform {pagestep}

The components need to be printed independently and get glued afterwards.
Instead of 3D printing, similar materials can be used, too.
