# Construction of the head fixation and platform tracking

In order do keep the head and camera in the same place a rigid mount is needed.

## Placing vertical mounting {pagestep}

Drill three threads inside the 48 cm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the [center air table](fromstep){Qty:1} . Two threads must point upwards, one thread on each rod in the center. The other thread must point downwards and is placed at a distance of 2cm from the center. Place in each thread one of the [M5 round rods](framework.yml#M5Rod){Qty:3}. Attach on each [M5 round rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) a [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC){Qty:3} 15 cm below/ above the table. 


## Attaching the camera {pagestep}

Place the [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the downwards pointing rod in a right angle. Cut a 20cm long piece with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw) from the [aluminium rod (12mm diameter)](framework.yml#12mmRod){Qty:1} and place in the [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the downwards pointing rod in a right angle. The 20cm [rod](framework.yml#12mmRod) should reach about 18cm towards the center of the table. On this rod attach the [Pixy Camera](electronic.yml#PixyCam){Qty:1} in the center below the table.





## Attaching the head fixation {pagestep}

Place one [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on each of the upwards pointing rods in a right angle. 

Cut a 38 cm long piece with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw) from the [aluminium rod (12mm diameter)](framework.yml#12mmRod) {Qty:1} and place in both [connecting clamps](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the upwards pointing rods. On this rod attach the [headfixation](electronic.yml#PixyCam){Qty:1} in the above below the table.

If the head fixation for the study needed is incompatible to this construction, a placement on the vertical [M5 thread rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) might work.
