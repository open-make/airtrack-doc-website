# Floating platform

There are several platforms you can use on the Airtrack. The shape of the platfrom varies depending on your research question. 

It's important to be aware about the influence of the material's surface to the mouse. The layer height and the material of the print are the main factors of the surface's shape after printing. In the context of your experiment it's recommended to modify the surface of the platform after printing it.
A 3D printed platform mostly has a flat and slippery surface which doesn't allow the mouse to move as expected. It's recommended to attach some grips or slip-proof materials to allow the mouse to move naturally. Some solutions for this are here XXXXXX.

All recommended printing settings provided the best output on a FLASHFORGE CREATOR 3.

The large platforms have been designed for the Airtrack with the dimensions in the guide. However, small Airtracks have been designed and have their usability.
The large platform has a flat ground because it needs to push the balls within the upper air table down. In contrast, the small platform has a rim because no balls are needed for smaller Airtracks. The balls are used to limit the air flow and by this the needed pressure is reduced to maintain the platform floating.

## Large platform {pagestep}

The components need to be printed independently and get glued afterwards.
Instead of 3D printing, similar materials can be used, too.
