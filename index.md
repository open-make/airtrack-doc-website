# Construction guidance of an Airtrack

This website will guide you through the hole process of building an Airtrack by yourself. The website is part of the output from the open.make project. This project aims to further establish open hardware in science e.g. by supporting scientist replicating research and providing guides to research hardware. The Airtrack was first published in the paper titled Air-Track: a real-world floating environment for active sensing in head-fixed mice in Journal of Neurophysiology 1 October 2016 Vol. 116. It was developed within in Larkum Lab by Mostafa Nashaat, Hatem Oraby, Robert Sachdev, York Winter and Matthew Larkum as well as Alexander Schill from the Charite Workshop. In this repository the reconstruction of the airtrack is documented in end to provide a construction guide.
