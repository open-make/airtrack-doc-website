1. Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Create a new Arduino sketch: Open the Arduino IDE, and create a new sketch by clicking "File" > "New". 
3. Save the sketch in the project related folder and add the header files: definitions.h, leds.h, mpr.h, sensor.h, acuator.h and pins.h) inside the folder. 
4. Further add the airtrack.ino file in the same folder.
5. Connect the Arduino: Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
6. Select the Arduino board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" > "Board" and select the appropriate Arduino board (e.g., "Arduino Uno"). Then, go to "Tools" > "Port" and select the port corresponding to your connected Arduino board.
7. Compile, check for errors and upload the code to your Arduino board.
