# Construction of the air table

## Predrill plexiglass plates {pagestep}

Follow the [instruction](Predrill.md) to prapre the top and side plexiglass plates.

## Cleaning the plexiglass {pagestep}

Before beginning any gluing work, the pieces must be degreased (with soap and water) and free of any remaining screwing or other dirt.

The first step is to build the central plexiglas box where the air is floating through. 

- Use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192){qty:some, Cat:tool} to combine the [predrilled 480mmx326mm plexiglass plate](fromstep){Qty:1} with two [310mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#310x64pg){Qty:2}, on the shorter edges. 8 mm should remain on both sides. 


- Use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) [i](glueingadvise.md) to add the [predrilled 480x64 plexiglass plate](fromstep){qty:2}. Put some glue on the 3 edges touching other plexiglas plates.

Wait for the glue to be dry before going to the next step.

## Screwing {pagestep}

To further stabilize the box you need to drill screws from the side into the box from several places. 

- Mark every place for a screw
    - For the long sides, mark 8 holes with a distance of 59 mm between them, starting at the corner (at 4 mm of the border of the plate)
    - For the short sides, mark 5 new holes at 54, 104, 163,222,272,322 mm of the side.

- Predrilled each mark with a [1mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill){qty:1, cat:tool}.  

- Drill a [3mm pozidriv screws](screws.yml#3mm_pozidriv){Qty:26} in each hole.

## Glue bottom plate

The bottom plate is meant to disconnect first if the pressure in the box gets too high. Therefore the bottom plate is not screwed.

- Glue the not predrilled bottom plate [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg){Qty:1} below the box.

## Inserting of hose connection gland and pressure relief valve {pagestep}

These components take care of the incoming air and protect against overpressure.

- Choose one short side of the box and drill in the center of the the plexiglass a hole with a [G 1/4" thread drill](tools.yml#G1_4_thread_drill).

>!! put this step as a predrilling step.

- Now insert the [reducing fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting){Qty:1}. Place with distance of 7,5cm two more threads with a [G 1/8" thread drill](tools.yml#G1_8_thread_drill) on both side of the last thread. 

- Place inside these threads the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8){Qty:2}. You can place on the [reducing fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting) the [pressure relief valve](connectors.yml#pressure_relief_valve){Qty:1}. 

    - It's recommended to remove it during works on the Airtable.

- Combine two 200 mm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose){Qty:2} with an [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8){Qty:1}. 

- Append to the in one direction pointing end of the [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8) another [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the length of your need. 

- Connect both 200 mm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8).

You have build the [air table center box]{output, qty:1} now.
