# Construction of the air table center

## Predrill of plexiglass plates {pagestep}

Drill several holes (0.8 cm diameter) into the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg){Qty:1} as shown in the following drawing. The given distances in the first picture can be transfered to all other holes.
 After drilling remove remains of drilling. Now you have a predrilled 480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate.

To connect the central box with the table legs the long side of the central box needs connection points. 
Therefore drill a hole on each end of both [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg){Qty:2} with a [5mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill). Keep a distance of 4.5 cm to the end edge and 1 cm to the top. Drill two more holes inside both [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg) with a distance of 12.5cm towards the plate's center.


## Cleaning the plexiglass {pagestep}

Before beginning any gluing work, the pieces must be degreased (soap and water) and without any remaining screwing or other dirt.

## Glueing {pagestep}

The first step is to build the central plexiglas box where the air is floating through. Therefore use the acrylic glue to combine the predrilled [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with 2 [310mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#310x64pg){Qty:2}. These are placed on the shorter edge of the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with a space of 8mm on both sides. You are able to mark the corner spaces with a pen on the 8mm height of the largest plexiglas plate. Then use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) [i](glueingadvise.md) to connect the components. Now [glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) the [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg). Don't forget to put glue between both plexiglass components with 6.4 cm height. You now have the upper side of the air table center. The bottom plate will be glued later.

## Screwing {pagestep}

To further stabilize the box you need to drill screws from the side into the box from several places. Every place for screws must be predrilled with a [1mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill).  
Start with the long sides, predrill from the top into the upper plexiglas with a distance of 5.9 cm between each screw. The corner hole has a center distance of 4mm on both sides. Continue with the short upper side, keep a distance of 5 cm between holes. The center hole has a distance of 5.9 cm to both neighbor screws

Now drill [3mm pozidriv screws](screws.yml#3mm_pozidriv){Qty:Many} in each hole.

The bottom plate is meant to disconnect first if the pressure in the box gets too high. Therefore the bottom plate is not screwed down.

You have build the [air table center box]{output, qty:1} now.
