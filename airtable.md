# Construction of the air table center

## Predrill of plexiglass plates {pagestep}

Drill several holes (1 cm diameter) into the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg){Qty:1} as shown in the following drawing. After drilling remove remains of drilling. Now you have a predrilled 480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate. 

### Missing drawing

To connect the central box with the table legs the long side of the central box needs connection points. 
Therefore drill a hole on each end of both [480mm x 50mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x50pg){Qty:2} with a [5mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill). Keep a distance of 5 cm to the end edge and 1,5 cm to the top.


## Cleaning the plexiglass {pagestep}

Before beginning any gluing work, the pieces must be degreased (soap and water) and without any remaining screwing or other dirt.

## Glueing {pagestep}

The first step is to build the central plexiglas box where the air is floating through. Therefore use the acrylic glue to combine the predrilled [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with 2 [305,6mm x 50mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#306x50pg){Qty:2}. These are placed on the shorter edge of the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with a space of 1 cm on both sides. You are able to mark the corner spaces with a pen on the 1 cm height of the largest plexiglas plate. Then use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) [i](glueingadvise.md) to connect the components. Now [glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) the [480mm x 50mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x50pg). Don't forget to put glue between both plexiglass components with 5 cm height. You now have the upper side of the air table center. The bottom plate will be glued later.

## Screwing {pagestep}

To further stabilise the box you need to drill screws from the side into the box from several places. Every place for screws must be predrilled with a [1mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill).  Start with the top on the long sides, drill [3mm pozidriv screws](screws.yml#3mm_pozidriv){Qty:Many} from the top into the upper plexiglas (the one with predrilled holes) with a distance of 6 cm to each screw, 3 cm on both edges and 0,5 cm to the long side edge. Continue with the short upper side, keep a distance of 3 cm to both edges, a distance of 4,5 cm (one distance needs to be about 4cm) and again 0,5 to the side edge. The last place to screw are the corners from the side. Place two screws from the continuous side through into the non continuous with a distance of 1,75 cm to the closest edge of lower/upper plate and 0,5 cm again to the side edge. 
The bottom plate is meant to disconnect first if the pressure in the box gets to high. Therefore the bottom plate is not screwed down.
