# Construction of the air table center

## Predrill of plexiglass plates {pagestep}

Drill several holes (0.8 cm diameter) into the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg){Qty:1} as shown in the following drawing. The given distances in the first picture can be transfered to all other holes.
 After drilling remove remains of drilling. Now you have a predrilled 480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate.

To connect the central box with the table legs the long side of the central box needs connection points. 
Therefore drill a hole on each end of both [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg){Qty:2} with a [5mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill). Keep a distance of 4.5 cm to the end edge and 1 cm to the top. Drill two more holes inside both [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg) with a distance of 12.5cm towards the plate's center.


## Cleaning the plexiglass {pagestep}

Before beginning any gluing work, the pieces must be degreased (soap and water) and without any remaining screwing or other dirt.

## Glueing {pagestep}

The first step is to build the central plexiglas box where the air is floating through. Therefore use the acrylic glue to combine the predrilled [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with two [310mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#310x64pg){Qty:2}. These are placed on the shorter edge of the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) with a space of 8mm on both sides. You are able to mark the corner spaces with a pen on the 8mm height of the largest plexiglas plate. Then use the [arcylic glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) [i](glueingadvise.md) to connect the components. Now [glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) the [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg). Don't forget to put glue between both plexiglass components with 6.4 cm height. You now have the upper side of the air table center. The bottom plate will be glued later.

## Screwing {pagestep}

To further stabilize the box you need to drill screws from the side into the box from several places. Every place for screws must be predrilled with a [1mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#1mmdrill).  
Start with the long sides, predrill from the top into the upper plexiglas with a distance of 5.9 cm between each screw. The corner hole has a center distance of 4mm on both sides. Continue with the short upper side, keep a distance of 5 cm between holes. The center hole has a distance of 5.9 cm to both neighbor screws

Now drill [3mm pozidriv screws](screws.yml#3mm_pozidriv){Qty:Many} in each hole.

The bottom plate is meant to disconnect first if the pressure in the box gets too high. Therefore the bottom plate is not screwed down.

## Inserting of hose connection gland and pressure relief valve {pagestep}

Choose one short side of the box and drill in the center of the the plexiglass a hole with a [G 1/4" thread drill](tools.yml#G1_4_thread_drill). Now insert the [reducing_fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting){Qty:1}. Place with distance of 7,5cm two more threads with a [G 1/8" thread drill](tools.yml#G1_8_thread_drill) on both side of the last thread. Place inside these threads the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8){Qty:2}. You can place on the [reducing_fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting) the [pressure relief valve](connectors.yml#pressure_relief_valve){Qty:1}. It's recommended to remove it during works on the Airtable. Further combine two 20cm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose){Qty:many} with an [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8){Qty:1}. Append to the in one direction pointing end of the [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8) another [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the length of your need. Connect both 20cm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8).





You have build the [air table center box]{output, qty:1} now.
