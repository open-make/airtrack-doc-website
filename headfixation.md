# Construction of the head fixation 

The animal will be head fixed in the center of the platform. Here is a description of the setup construction using XXX head fixation method.

If the head fixation system you have is incompatible with this construction, a placement on the vertical [M5 thread rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) might work.

- Place three [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:6} in each 480 mm [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod){qty:2} of the [center air table](fromstep){Qty:1}, pointing upwards. 

- Move the central nuts to the center of the two 480 mm [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod).

- Place in each central nut one of the [M5 round rods](framework.yml#M5Rod){Qty:2}. Attach on each [M5 round rod](framework.yml#M5Rod) a [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC){Qty:2} 150 mm  above the table. 

## Attaching the head fixation {pagestep}

- Place one [connecting clamp](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on each of the upwards pointing rods in a 90 degree angle.

>!! 2 or 6 clamps?

- Cut a 380 mm long piece of an  [aluminium rod 12mm diameter](framework.yml#12mmRod){Qty:1} with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw){Qty:1, cat: tool}, and place it in both [connecting clamps](connectors.yml#12mmCC) on the upwards pointing rods. On this rod attach the headfixation.
