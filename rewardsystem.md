# Construction of the rewarding system

We will fix here a linear actuator that will bring the reward to the animal. The reward itself is delivered with two solenoid valves.

A buzzer is added to the system but do not need to be fixed to the table.

## Additional framework {pagestep}

The following element will be placed on the air table struts opposite of the pressure relief valve.

- Place two outside pointing [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} in each vertical [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the [center air table](fromstep){qty:1}. Place one below the lower framework and one close to the top of the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). 

- Attach to all nuts an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:4} by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4}. The angles must point to each other.

- Attach to both sides vertical an [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) which raises 250 mm above the airtable by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4} and [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4}. 

- The exact length is depending on your choices of the general height. 

- Now place one [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} in each just attached, vertical [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). The [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) in each [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) needs to point to each other. 

    - Attach to these [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:2} by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}. The unattached side needs to point towards the air table. 

- Cut one [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) with a length of 326 mm and place it horizontal at the vertical [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) pointing to the air table.

 - Use two [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} and two [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2} to fixate the [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod).

- The lower edge  should be at the height of the  air table surface.

## Platform borders {pagestep}

- Place three [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:6} in each upper [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the U-formation frame. 
    - Insert them from the pressure reliefe side.

- Use the deepest two [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) and place them with a distance of 150 mm from the center in both directions. Attach an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:4} to each by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4}. 

- The angles should point towards the air table.

- Fixate the [350mm x 30mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#350x30pg){Qty: 1} with two [M5 screws (12mm)](screws.yml#m5x12mm_screw){Qty:4} and two [M5 hexagon nuts](screws.yml#m5_hexagon_nuts){Qty:4} at the angles on both sides.
- Mark and predrill the spots of the angle holes at the plexiglass for the screws with a [5mm drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill).


- Place the remaining nuts **???** at the end of the [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) of the U-formation frame.

- Attach two [angles](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:2} to the [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}. 

- The angles should point to the outside.


- Mark the angle holes at the [366mm x 30mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#366x30pg){Qty: 1} and predrill them with a [5mm drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill).

- Attach the [366mm x 30mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#366x30pg) by using two [M5 screws (12mm)](screws.yml#m5x12mm_screw){Qty:2} and two [M5 hexagon nuts](screws.yml#m5_hexagon_nuts){Qty:2}.






## Fixing the linear actuator {pagestep}


- Choose one long side of the U-formation framework and drill a [1/4" thread](tools.yml#1_4_thread_drill) inside the upper [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) on the opposite side of the pressure relief valve.
     - Keep a 50 mm distance from the end of the [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod).

- Place the [SmallRig articulated_arm](framework.yml#smallrig_articulated_arm){Qty:1} in the thread with one side. 
- On the other side of the [SmallRig articulated arm](framework.yml#smallrig_articulated_arm) place the [SmallRig super clamp](framework.yml#smallrig_super_clamp){Qty:1}. 

- Place the [linear actuator](electronic.yml#LinActuator50mm){Qty:1} in the [SmallRig Super Clamp](framework.yml#smallrig_super_clamp) close to the center end of the not moving part. 

- The front hole in the [linear actuator](electronic.yml#LinActuator50mm) needs to point upwards.


- Move the articulated arm and linear actuator to have the linear actuator orientated along the long side and centered. The moveable end needs to point towards the pressure relief valve. The super clamp should be around 10 cm above the table and 5 cm from the short airtable edge. The linear actuator should point around 30Â° downwards.



## Fixing the solenoid pinch valve {pagestep}

Place one [solenoid pinch valve](electronic.yml#pv){Qty:2} at the top of each vertical [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). 

- Therefore place a [nut](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} at the top of each [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) and fixate a  [pinch valve clamp](electronic.yml#pv_clamp){Qty:1} on each with a [M5 screw (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}.

- Place the [solenoid pinch valve](electronic.yml#pv) inside the [pinch valve clamp](electronic.yml#pv_clamp).
