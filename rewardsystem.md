# Construction of the rewarding system



## Additional framework

The following modification will be placed on the opposite of the pressure relief valve.

Place two outside pointing [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} in each [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). Place one below the lower framework and one close to the top of the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). Attach to all an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:4} by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4}. The angles must point to each other.
Attach to both sides vertical an [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) which raises 25cm above the airtable by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4} and [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4}. The exact length is depending on your choices of the general height. 

Now place two [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} in each vertical [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). One [nut](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) in each [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) needs point to each other. Attach to these [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:2} by using [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4}. The other nuts need to point towards the center of the air table. Cut one [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) with a length of 32,6cm and place it horizontal at the vertical [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) pointing to the air table center. It should be 5cm above the air table an the bottom side. Place in the horizontal [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) two more [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} which need to point upwards later. Use more [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2} and [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} to connect it with the upper angles and place it towards the inside.

## Platform borders

Use the lower, just placed nuts to add a [286mm x 30mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#286x30pg){Qty:1}. Align both 3cm high endings with the edges of the vertical [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) and mark the center of the [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) on the plexiglass . Predill with 1,5cm distance to the edges two holes with a [5mm drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill) at the marks. Align the nuts with holes. Fixate the [286mm x 30mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#286x30pg) with two [M5 screws (12mm)](screws.yml#m5x12mm_screw){Qty:2}.

Use the remaining [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) in the upper 48cm long [aluminium strut profiles](framework.yml#20x20Rod) next to the head fixation rods and place two [286mm x 30mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#286x30pg){Qty:2} in the center of  side by using four [M5 screws (12mm)](screws.yml#m5x12mm_screw){Qty:4}, four [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4} and four [angles](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:4}. 

To achieve a border at the side of the pressure relieve valve place a [nut](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} at this side in the top framework edge and attach an [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:2} to each nut by using a [M5 screw (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}. Cut a 32,6cm long [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) and use two more [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2} and [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2} to fixate it.

## Linear actuator

Place [Linear Actuator](electronic.yml#LinActuator50mm){Qty:1} on the lower horizontal [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) and fixate it to the upwards pointing [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts) by using the included mount with [M5 screws (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}.

 
 

## Solenoid pinch valve

Place one [solenoid pinch valve](electronic.yml#pv){Qty:2} at the top of each vertical [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod). Therefore place a [nut](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:2}
 at the top of each [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod) and fixate a  [pinch valve clamp](electronic.yml#pv_clamp){Qty:1} on each with a [M5 screw (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:2}.
Place the [solenoid pinch valve](electronic.yml#pv) inside the [pinch valve clamp](electronic.yml#pv_clamp).
