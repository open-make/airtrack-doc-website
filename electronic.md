# Set up of the electric system

## Wiring of devices

- In order to connect the devices you need a circuit board, e.g. this [circuit board](electronic.yml#circuit_board){Qty:1}. 

- Further you need many jumper wires to set up connections accordingly to the following circuit drawing. You need male, female and ordinary wires. 

- To clean up the pathing of cables you can use cable ties like, e.g. these [cable ties](connectors.yml#cable_tie){Qty:many} and fixate with that the cables at the [aluminium strut profile](framework.yml#20x20Rod).

- To keep a structure between the [Arduino Uno](electronic.yml#Arduino_Uno){Qty:1}, [Capcitive sensor mpr121](electronic.yml#mpr121){Qty:1}, [Active Buzzer](electronic.yml#Keyes_KY-012){Qty:1}
 and [H bridge L293D](electronic.yml#L293D){Qty:1} you can use a large breadboard.
