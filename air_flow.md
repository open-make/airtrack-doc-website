- Insert the [reducing fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting){Qty:1} in the G 1/4" thread.

- Place on the [reducing fitting](connectors.yml#R_1_4_R_1_4_reducing_fitting) the [pressure relief valve](connectors.yml#pressure_relief_valve){Qty:1}. 


- Place inside the G 1/8" threads the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8){Qty:2}. 



## Air hose {pagestep}

- Combine two 200 mm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose){Qty:2} with an [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8){Qty:1}. 

- Append to the in one direction pointing end of the [Y-hose connector](connectors.yml#YS_Ges_8) another [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the length of your need to the air pressure source. 

- Connect both 200 mm [compressed air hose](connectors.yml#compressed_air_hose) with the [hose connection glands](connectors.yml#SV_Ges_8_R_1_8).



You have build the [center air table]{output, qty:1} now.
