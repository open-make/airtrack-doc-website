# Construction of the framework

Now you're going to connect the [air table center box](fromstep){Qty:1} with the surrounding framework.

## U-formation framework {pagestep}

Cut the [aluminium framework](framework.yml#20x20Rod) into two 48cm pieces and four pieces with a minimum of 20cm with a [metallsaw](tools.yml#metallsaw). The length of the four pieces is depending on your height preferences. A minimum of 20 cm is needed to have enough space for the camera below the table. The following is done twice. Place two [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} inside the two framework pieces with variable length, fixate on each a [angle](connectors.yml#5mmNuts_angle){Qty:4} with a [M5 screw (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4} at one end. Now connect both with the 48 cm long [aluminium framework](framework.yml#20x20Rod) by using a [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} and  [M5 screw (6mm)](screws.yml#m5x6mm_screw){Qty:4}.


## Applying the U-formation framework to the central air table {pagestep}

Place two [nuts](connectors.yml#5mmNuts){Qty:4} inside each 48 cm rod of the U-formation frameworks on one side which adjacent to the side with nuts already placed in (90 degrees to both rods which can vary in length), both sides work. Now line these nuts up with the holes inside [480mm x 50mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x50pg) of the central air table box. The holes in the [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plate](plexiglass.yml#480x326pg) need to point in the opposite direction as the two rods which can vary in length.
Connect the air table box and the U-formation framework with two [M5 screw (12mm)](screws.yml#m5x12mm_screw){Qty:4} from the inside of the air box in each nut. 

Repeat this step with the second U-formation framework on the other side of the air table box.


## Glueing of the bottom plate {pagestep}

After connecting the air table with the framework there is no need in accessing the inner box. Now [glue](tools.yml#acrifix_192) the second [480mm x 326mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x50pg){Qty:1} on the bottom side of the already build. Line up the long side of the box with the long side of the plate, there must be no hole for air flowing through. Again it's necessary to degrease and remove any dirt at the glueing surface before glueing.
