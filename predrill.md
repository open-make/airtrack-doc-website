## Predrill long sides {pagestep}





To connect the air table with the table legs, the long sides ([480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg)) of the central box needs connection points. 

- Drill four holes with a [5mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#5mmdrill){Qty: 1, Cat: Tool} in each of the two [480mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#480x64pg){Qty:2} following the drawing:
distance to top: 10 mm
distance to side: 45, 175, 265, 395










## Predrill short sides {pagestep}

Use the following drawing as an orientation to predrill both [310mm x 64mm plexiglass plates](plexiglass.yml#310x64pg){Qty:2} and both [predrilled 480x64 plexiglass plate](fromstep){qty:2}. 
The perspective of the drawing is from the top. Keep in mind the orientation of the [predrilled 480x64 plexiglass plate](fromstep). It's earlier holes should be close to the upper side.


#### Constructional drawing (distances in millimeter)
- Use a [2mm plexiglas drill](tools.yml#2mmdrill){qty: one,cat:tool} for drilling.
